Project Overview
================

Stained [glass] grids, plus a [realty] business card: explorations into making the web more beautiful. Or, a handful of tiles, many ways. 

`Vanilla JavaScript`, `Semantic HTML`, and `CSS Grid` are written plainly, but powerfully here for ease of artistic exploration. I enjoyed writing a class to eliminate repetitive HTML and to experiment with reworking this fun mini-project, which began some time ago after I initially met Grid.
